      Our version of this sativa-dominant strain is 100% certified organic. Her exceptionally aromatic flower gives off a blueberry aroma with a warm and peppery terpene profile. Hand-harvested and cold cured, these buds were carefully selected, trimmed and placed in a recyclable glass jar, sealed for freshness. Like any good dream, she’s both sweet and spicy.

      100% certified organic and teeming with exotic mystique. This sativa-dominant hybrid is rumoured to be derived from genetics in Africa and then perfected in Robert’s Creek on the Sunshine Coast, BC. Her abundance of red pistils and medium-density flowers offer a spicy sandalwood aroma and a natural pink glow. Grown in living soil then cold-cured, hand-trimmed and hand-packed in a recyclable glass jar sealed for freshness. She is truly a connoisseur’s cultivar.
